# BM-QXQ_Final_project

This repo contains my final project (the way it was submitted) for the course "Introduction to quantum computing" from QubitXQubit. Supplementary files with the project's Qiskit implementations are also included.

I would like to thank IBM for sponsoring my participation in this exciting experience.
